# Ensuring GymProvider Legitimacy

1. Staking Collateral for GymProviders

Staking Mechanism:
    - GymProviders must stake a certain amount of tokens as collateral to be eligible to list their gyms on the platform.
    - The amount should be significant enough to deter bad behavior but not so high that it discourages legitimate gyms from participating.

Determining Collateral Amount:
   - Initial Consideration: Calculate the average cost of gym membership in the areas served, and set the collateral to cover potential damages (e.g., a few months of average membership fees).
   - Example Calculation:
        Average monthly gym membership fee: $50
        Collateral to cover potential damages for 3 months: $50 x 3 = $150
    - Adjust this amount based on market conditions and feedback from gym providers.
  
Penalties for Misconduct:
    - If a gym is found to be fraudulent or fails to meet service standards, part or all of the staked collateral can be slashed.
    - Implement a decentralized arbitration mechanism to handle disputes and ensure fairness.

# User Access Mechanisms

Pay Per Access
Pay Periodic Access (Weekly|Monthly|Yearly)
    Time-based NFT:
        Users purchase an NFT that grants unlimited access for a certain period (e.g., one month).
        This NFT is valid for the duration of the period purchased.

Stake and Gain Access (Premium)
    Staking for Premium Access:
        Users stake a certain amount of tokens to gain premium access.
        The staking period might have a lock-up period (e.g., 30 days) to prevent immediate unstaking and ensure commitment.
        Premium access could include additional benefits such as priority booking, access to exclusive equipment, or premium facilities.
